# absolute-directory-test
This is where I test different capabilities of github-pages. 
click [here](https://qanazoga.com/github-pages-testing) to go to the main page.

### What works and what doesn't
- [x] absolute directories: linking to `/` from a self-contained page (hosted from your docs folder of a repo etc.) will go to the root page of the website (hosted from `yourname.github.io`)
- [ ] using a README.md (or any .md) as a page (untested)
- [ ] forwarding (untested)
